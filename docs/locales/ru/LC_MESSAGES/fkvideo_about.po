msgid ""
"To add video face detection to your FindFace Server Enterprise SDK "
"instance, you need the :program:`fkvideo_detector` component. This "
"component extracts faces from video and posts them to FindFace Server "
"over API for further processing. It can work with both live streams and "
"files, and supports all video file formats and codecs that can be decoded"
" by `FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#Supported-File-"
"Formats_002c-Codecs-or-Features>`__."

msgid ""
"When processing video, fkvideo_detector consequently uses the following "
"algorithms:"

#: ../source/fkvideo_about.rst:38
msgid ""
":program:`Motion detection`. This algorithm is aimed to reduce system "
"resources consumption. Only when the motion detector recognizes motion of"
" certain intensity in video that the face tracker can be triggered."

":program:`Face tracking`. The face tracker tracks, detects and captures "
"faces from video, and posts them to FindFace Server. It can "
"simultaneously process several faces."

"Each captured face is posted as a snapshot and a bbox in a request "
"``/face`` or ``/identify``, depending on the :ref:`configuration settings"

msgstr ""

#: ../source/fkvideo_about.rst:61
msgid ""
"The real-time mode allows posting a face immediately after it appears in "

#: ../source/fkvideo_about.rst:63

"First, the face tracker estimates whether the quality of a face snapshot "

#: ../source/fkvideo_about.rst:71
msgid ""
"The offline mode is less storage intensive than the real-time one as it "
"allows posting only one snapshot per face, but of the highest quality. In"
" this mode, the face tracker buffers a video stream with a face in it "
"until the face disappears from the camera field of view. Then the face "
"tracker picks up the best face snapshot from the buffered video and posts"
" it to FindFace Server."

msgid ""
"A list of streams has first to be posted to FindFace Server by applying "
"the :ref:`/camera POST <camera-post>` method to each stream. When "
"posting, all streams in the list have to be assigned a common user-"
"defined string, so called ``detector``. This string should then be "
"specified as the ``--detector-name`` option when configuring "
"fkvideo_detector. In this case, fkvideo_detector will retrieve the list "
"of streams from FindFace Server, based on their ``detector-name``, and "
"begin to process each stream individually. It will also be periodically "
"updating the list of cameras from FindFace Server with a polling interval"
" defined by the ``reload-timeout`` parameter."
