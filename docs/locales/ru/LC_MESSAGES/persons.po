msgstr ""

#: ../source/persons.rst:19
msgid ""
"An image containing a face (for example, extracted from a RTSP video "
"stream by the video face detector) is sent via a ``/face POST`` request "
"to FindFace Server for identification."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/persons.rst:20
msgid ""
"When identifying a person, the system uses a face property ``person_id``."
" For each person in the database, the value of this property should be "
"unique."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/persons.rst:21
msgid ""
"FindFace Server takes the new face and searches for the most similar one "
"in the database (the so-called reference face). If similarity between the"
" faces is equal or exceeds the threshold specified in the ``findface-"
"facenapi.ini`` configuration file (``person_identify_threshold``), the "
"new face is added to the database and assigned the same ``person_id`` "
"value as the reference face. It also inherits some other reference face "
"properties. This means that the new face has been identified as belonging"
" to an existing person."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/persons.rst:22
msgid ""
"If similarity between the faces does not exceed the given threshold, the "
"system considers the new face as unidentified. In this case, the new face"
" is added to the database as belonging to a new person, with a new "
"``person_id``."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/persons.rst:23
msgid ""
"In either case, FindFace Server returns a response containing the "
"``person_id`` value assigned to the added face. This value can be then "
"used in analysis."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/persons.rst:26
msgid ""
"On account of the very logic of dynamic person creation, resembling faces"
" of different people can be identified as belonging to one person and get"
" the same ``person_id``. To avoid this situation, we recommend you to "
"periodically inspect the person database and manually resolve each "
"identity conflict."

msgid "Configure Dynamic Person Creation"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/persons.rst:31
msgid ""
"By default, dynamic person creation is disabled. This means that all "
"newly added faces are not assigned the person_id property and the system "
"does not discern persons."

"By default, dynamic person creation is performed independently for each "
"camera. To merge person identification results across all cameras, "

"option works well only in small-scale systems with less than 5 cameras. "
"Otherwise, leave it deactivated."
