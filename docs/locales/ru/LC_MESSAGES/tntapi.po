"The tntapi component connects the Tarantool database and the facenapi "
"component, transferring search results from the database to facenapi for "
"further processing. To increase search speed, multiple tntapi shards can "
"be created on each Tarantool host. Their running concurrently leads to a "
"remarkable increase in performance. Each shard can handle up to "
"approximately 10,000,000 faces. In the case of standalone deployment, you"
" need only one shard (created by default), while in a cluster environment"
" the number of shards has to be calculated depending on several "
"parameters (see below)."
