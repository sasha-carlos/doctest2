   * - Option
     - Description
     - Argument
     - Example
   * - -c [ ‑‑config ] arg
     - Invokes fkvideo_detector with a given configuration file (``.ini``). The command line parameters and those in the configuration file have the same names and meaning, but if a parameter is set either way, the command line value has priority.
     - Path to the .ini configuration file. If you specify the file name alone (without the full path), fkvideo_detector will search for the file in the fkvideo_detector working directory. The default fkvideo_detector configuration file is ``/etc/fkvideo.ini``. If fkvideo_detector and :ref:`FindFace Web UI <ffui>` are running on the same host, avoid editing ``/etc/fkvideo.ini`` as it is also used by FindFace Web UI. Instead, make a copy of this file, edit the copy and specify it in the option ``-c`` when starting fkvideo_detector.
     - $ fkvideo_detector -c /etc/fkvideo_example.ini
   * - ‑‑license-ntls-server arg
     - Mandatory. Defines the IP address and port of :ref:`NTLS <licensing>`. Edit only if NTLS is remote.

In this case, if fkvideo_detector posts a face to FindFace Server and then tracks another one within the time period ``uc-max-time-diff``, and the distance between the two faces doesn't exceed ``uc-max-avg-shift``, fkvideo_detector estimates their similarity. If the faces are similar and the total number of similar faces during the ``uc-max-time-diff`` period does not exceed the number ``uc-max-dup``, fkvideo_detector posts the other face. Otherwise, the other face is not posted.
     - Boolean: 1 = only a certain number of faces belonging to one person are posted, 0 = all captured faces are posted.
     - ‑‑post-uniq 1

     - Maximum number of simultaneously tracked faces.
     - ‑‑max-persons 4
   * - ‑‑single-pass [=arg(=1)]
     - Disables periodical updates of the list of cameras. Use this option if fkvideo_detector should process a video file. In this case, fkvideo_detector will request the list of cameras only once.
     - Boolean: 1 = updates are disabled, 0 = updates are enabled. ‑‑ single-pass and ‑‑single-pass 1 are equal.

   * - ‑‑sink-res arg
     - Defines the output video stream resolution.
     - Resolution WхH
     - ‑‑sink-res 1280x720
   * - ‑‑tracker-threads arg
     - Defines the number of tracking threads for the face tracker. This value should be less or equal to the ``max-persons`` value. We recommend you to set them equal. If the number of tracking threads is less than the maximum number of tracked faces, resource consumption is reduced but so is the tracking speed.
     - Number of tracking threads
     - ‑‑tracker-threads 4
   * - -h [ ‑‑help ]
     - Produce the fkvideo_detector help message.
