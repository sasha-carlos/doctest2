FindFace Enterprise Server SDK consists of the :program:`Biometric Data Analysis and Recognition Server` (:program:`FindFace Server` or :program:`Server` hereinafter) and, optionally, the video face detector and other :ref:`additional components <extra-functionality>`. 

The FindFace Server functioning is provided by interaction of the following components: 

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Component", "Description"
   :widths: 15 40
   :file: _tables/components.csv
   :encoding: UTF-8
   :delim: ;
