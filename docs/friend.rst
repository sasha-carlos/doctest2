About Friends and Foes
--------------------------------

The 'friend or foe' identification system of FindFace Enterprise Server
SDK can positively identify only friends, not foes. A friend is a person
whose face has been captured a certain number of days by the same camera
during a certain period of time. In all other cases, a person is just
considered to be 'not a friend'.

Enable 'Friend or Foe' Identification
-------------------------------------------

To enable 'friend or foe' identification, do the following:

#. Configure and tryout :ref:`dynamic person creation <persons>`.

#. Open the ``findface-facenapi.ini`` configuration file for editing.

   .. code::

       sudo vi /etc/findface-facenapi.ini

#. Edit the settings.

   .. warning::
        The ``findface-facenapi.ini`` content must be correct Python code.

   A friend is a person that has been seen a certain number of days by the same camera during an interval ``[now() - $interval ; now()]``. Uncomment and edit the number of days a person has to be seen to befriend your system.
   
   .. code::

            → friend_count = 5
   
   Interval in seconds during which a person has to be seen a certain number of days (1 week by default)::

            → friend_interval = (3600*24*7)

#. Restart the service.

   .. code::

       sudo service findface-facenapi restart
